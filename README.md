# FMLogger

Easy logging for iOS 4.0+.

## Usage

To begin using FMLogger, just drop the class into your project and import where used.

Logs files, by default, are saved to .../Documents/Logs

Use the following in place of NSLog:

	FMLoggerVerbose(fmt, ...)  // for detailed informational messages used for debugging
	
	FMLoggerInfo(fmt, ...)     // for general informational messages that highlight the progress of the application

	FMLoggerWarning(fmt, ...)  // for informational messages that highlight potential error events

	FMLoggerError(fmt, ...)    // for informational messages pretaining to error events
	
### Example usage

	FMLoggerVerbose(@"Processing list with name: %@", list.name);
